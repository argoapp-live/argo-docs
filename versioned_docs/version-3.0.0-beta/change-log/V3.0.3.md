This is the changelog notes for the **V3.0.3-beta** release. Check out the following updates made in this release.

## XSS Vulnerability Fix

One of our beta testers has identified XSS vulnerability on avatar change for the organization and user profile. We have fixed this by restricting the image uploads to only png, jpg & jpeg. Also in our API, we are using web3.storage to upload these avatar images on IPFS and store it in our database. This reduces the chance of storing malicious code directly in our database.

## Override Install Command and Build Command

In this release, we have added an option for users to override the install command and build command. We have also removed the dependency on the package manager to make it easy for the developer to update their custom commands.

## Stop deployment Feature

You may have created a development that you don't need anymore, Previously, it was necessary to wait for such deployments to complete. Today we have implemented a stop deployment feature.

**Users can**

- Cancel deployments if they are no longer needed
- Stop their deployments in any state (Queue, Progress)

**Note**:

- If the deployment is in a Queue state, the deployment will be canceled immediately.
- If the deployment is in the Progress state, the deployment will first go in the Killing state, and then when the deployment task is killed, the status will change to Cancelled.
- We will store all the logs and build time if the deployment is canceled.

## Arweave Upload Boost

We have identified that uploading files on arweave sometime gives 404 due to the arweave network rejecting the file uploads.

**To Fix this:**

- We implemented an automatic reward boosting mechanism that will boost the transaction reward by 1.5x.
- Whenever the pending transaction is more than the maximum amount of transactions Arweave can handle in a block, the boost will get applied automatically and shown in the logs.
