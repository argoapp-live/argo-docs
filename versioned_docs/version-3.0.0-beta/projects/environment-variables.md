Environment Variables are key-value pairs set up outside of your source code that allow each value to vary based on the environment.

Spheron environment variables are accessible during your build. This allows you to change behaviors based on deploy parameters or to include information you donâ€™t want to save in your repository, such as API keys.

All values are encrypted in transit and viewable to any user with Project access. Both non-sensitive and sensitive data, such as tokens, are safe to utilize.

### Adding Environment Variable
