**Handshake** is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol where every peer is validating and in charge of managing the root DNS naming zone with the goal of creating an alternative to existing Certificate Authorities and naming systems.

In essence, Handshake takes a core piece of internet infrastructure, DNS's root zone file, and puts it on a blockchain. At a high level, Handshake is just decentralized DNS, but solving the [CA problem](https://www.namebase.io/blog/meet-handshake-decentralizing-dns-to-improve-the-security-of-the-internet/) and making it possible to self-custody, use, and transfer names permissionlessly in a publicly-verifiable way opens up exciting applications for developers that weren't feasible before Handshake.

:::info Note

We are using [Namebase](https://www.namebase.io/) to interact with Handshake Domains and provide users an easy way to configure it for their decentralized websites. Namebase is an NFT name registrar that operates on the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy to get your own NFT username on Handshake. You can use your Handshake name for secure login, decentralized websites, and decentralized top-level domain names.

## Why Handshake?

1. **Owned, not rented** - Own your name instead of renting domains or relying on the whims of big platforms. You control your name and can do whatever you want with it.

2. **Free second-level names** - Give your team decentralized usernames like satoshi.acme, vitalik.acme, or set up decentralized websites for your projects like bitcoin.nakamoto, bitdns.nakamoto.

3. **Sovereign identity** - Control your own identity and create redirects for your online presence like facebook.yourname, twitter.yourname, github.yourname.

4. **Secure** - Handshake makes it possible to login to websites securely without third parties.

5. **Private** - Use Namebaseâ€™s private bidding feature to register names and deploy websites anonymously.

6. **Monetize your name** - Sell second-level names to others or flip your name in our marketplace for a profit.
