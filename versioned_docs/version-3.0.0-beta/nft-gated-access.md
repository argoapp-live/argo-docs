### What is NFT Gated Access?

NFT Based app access to the platform will allow only whitelisted developers and companies to access the platform. This strategy is brought into the picture to solve issues during our early laying and also helps us to bifurcate our beta and pro users.

On a high level, we are bringing NFT gated access to onboard 3000 developers and allowing them to test the new app.

### Why NFT Gated Access?

It has been evident across the Web3 space that NFT is playing a very vital role in driving user adoption. NFT also gives developers and companies to have a sense of ownership of the community in which they are involved.

NFT gated access will also help us to drive a calculated user adoption on the platform by providing a premium to our early adopters.

### What additional value NFT will give to the community?

NFT allocated from the platform can be traded in the open market and gives the community a chance to bid on its value. Since these NFTs will provide special privilege access to selected individuals, owning an NFT will give full access to any new premium features coming on the platform.

Once our Subscription goes live most of these NFT owners will be provided with a new NFT that will grant them free access to the platform for 6 months.

### How to mint these NFTs?

Once our new app goes online for everyone, developers landing on the page will only be able to see and perform any actions on the platform if and only if they hold these NFTs.

Below are the steps following which they will be able to mint these NFTs -

- Eth or ENS addresses will get whitelisted in the contract after running a campaign on Twitter and other social media accounts
- Developers whitelisted can refer to other developers for getting whitelisted
- Developers who missed the whitelisting can request the referral on Twitter by sharing their eth address and tagging spheronHQ
- Our partners will get whitelisted by the SpheronHq team
- All of our existing users have to provide their eth address by tweeting and tagging us on social media platforms and after which they will be whitelisted

### How many total NFTs will be allocated?

The total number of these NFTs will be 10000.

### How many users we are targeting to onboard in the initial launch?

We want to onboard at least 3000 people with the new launch of the NFT.

### Are we going to set any price for minting these NFTs?

### What will happen with the collected $MATIC?
