Spheron supports multiple decentralized protocols that you can use to deploy your app. Choose the protocol that best suits your needs. Currently, Spheron supports these 4 protocols. They are Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin, and Pinata.

### Arweave

Arweave is a new sort of storage that backs data with long-term and eternal endowments, letting users and developers genuinely retain data forever. Arweave allows us to recall and store vital information, apps, and history permanently as a jointly owned hard drive that never forgets. It stops others from rewriting history by conserving it.

### Skynet

Skynet applications expand the boundaries of what is possible on the internet. Beyond safeguarding privacy, decentralization allows for application, integration, and innovation that the centralized world just cannot match. We can now break free from the walled gardens and data silos that have stifled innovation and interoperability in the past. Decentralization's key elements, such as user-owned personal data, permanent identification across applications, and censorship resistance, will become the new digital world's norms.

### Filecoin

Filecoin is an IPFS based decentralized network that allows for storing data accessible from virtually anywhere. Users can also offer their available storage as nodes on the network and earn Filecoin as data is stored and retrieved on those nodes.

### Pinata

Pinata builds tools and infrastructure that make it easy for Web3 developers to create and manage content on IPFS while also leading a change in how the world stores, accesses, and verifies blockchain-linked content. With a friendly, intuitive user interface that makes the most of the IPFS Pinning Service API, Pinata truly is a game-changer for Web3, making development easier and improving data confidence for a wide variety of use cases.
