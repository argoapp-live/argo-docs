Here are some Spheron Protocol use cases, which can illustrate the possible adoption of Spheron. We are going to publish a separate article on Medium that will be specifically dedicated to this topic.

Few examples of the use cases are mentioned below:

### Web3 Web Deployment

Spheron provides web deployment tools and other features to monitor, audit, and collaborate with other team members all in one place.

### Web3 Assets Storage

Spheron can store, retrieve any assets and also will provide feasibility to developers and admins to monitor the versions of those assets.

### DeFi And DEX Services

Spheron can store and retrieve large hybrid datasets for these services: like payout schedules and token bonding curves: most of these data aren’t frequently accessed but must be stored for a very long time or even forever.

### Blockchain-based Game

Spheron can help game developers with the cheap and reliable storage for tons of data concerning the players’ activities, which must be archived and stored for a very long time for different purposes (to make the game process, payments, and rewards most transparent and auditable).

### Wiki Sites

As time goes on, a lot of wiki links are getting broken. These sites can be hosted on Spheron so that they can live permanently without a need for recurring payments.

### Institutions

For web-app archivals to save cost in the long run.
