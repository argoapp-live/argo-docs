### Steps to add a Custom Domain

- Go to your Dashboard and select your Project
- Click on Domain tab and enter the domain you would like to add
- From here you will either have to confirm that you already own this domain or if you do not own the domain name and that it is available, you can buy it through ArGo.

## Adding Custom Subdomain

You can create your Subdomains to organize and navigate to different sections of your Domain. You can create multiple subdomains or child domains on your main domain.

- Go to the Subdomains tab and add your Subdomain
