In ArGo, all the domains will be pointed to the latest deployed transaction in Arweave.

<!-- ## Domain redirects

If you have multiple domains assigned to your site, you can redirect visitors between them or add other custom redirect and rewrite rules based on the domain entered into the browser by your visitors.

For more information, visit the docs on domain-level redirects.

## Apex domains and `www` subdomains

When you assign an apex domain (eg. `argoanimal.com`) or a `www` subdomain (eg. `www.argoanimal.com`) as the primary domain for your site, two entries are added to the **Custom domains** panel:

- one entry for the apex domain, and
- one entry for the www subdomain.

The primary domain is the custom domain you entered. The other entry is for the alternative domain that gets redirected automatically to the primary domain.

- If you set the `www` subdomain as your primary domain, ArGo will automatically redirect the apex domain to the `www` subdomain.

- If you set the apex domain as your primary domain, ArGo will automatically redirect the `www` subdomain to the apex domain.

:::info
Unless your DNS provider supports CNAME flattening for apex domains, we strongly recommend setting the `www` subdomain (or another subdomain) as your primary domain.
