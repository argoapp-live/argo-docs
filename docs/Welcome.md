ArGo is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. Integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling as your projects grow.

## Get started

To get started with ArGo, learn how to create deploys. Options for creating deploys range from connecting a Git repository for continuous deployment to publishing a site folder with drag and drop. Use the Deploy to ArGo button on our Jamstack templates to create a Git repository linked to a ArGo site that you can experiment with.

## Discover ArGo

Explore our documentation to learn about ArGo products and features. Here are some highlights from each section of the docs:

**Configure builds** – ArGo can run your build command and deploy the result whenever you push to your Git repo. Get started with basic build settings, learn about managing build dependencies, and explore additional options available with file-based configuration.

**Site deploys** – Atomic deploys with ArGo guarantee that your site is always consistent. Learn how to manage deploys, enable deploy notifications, and run a branch-based split test.

**Domains & HTTPS** – Register a new domain in the ArGo UI, or use a domain you already own, to assign a custom domain to your site. Either way, you can have ArGo handle DNS management for you. We provide free automatic HTTPS on all sites.

**Visitor access** – Enable site-wide password protection, authenticate users with ArGo Identity, or configure role-based access control.

**Forms** – You can use ArGo Forms without adding API calls or extra JavaScript on your site, configure extra spam prevention beyond our automatic spam filtering, and receive notifications about new submissions.

**Functions** – Deploy serverless functions built with JavaScript or with Go. You can even execute Background Functions for long-running tasks and trigger function calls when certain ArGo events happen.

**Large Media** – Get the benefits of Git version tracking for large files without bloating your repository. Use dynamic image transformations so you can upload images at full resolution, then serve the exact size you need when you need it.

**API** – To get started with the ArGo API, learn how to authenticate and make a request. Then explore options for deploying via API and usage for some popular endpoints.

**Accounts & billing** – Learn about managing team members and how to transfer sites between teams.

**Get help** - Explore self-serve and interactive help resources. Get tips for requesting support by email to help our support engineers help you.
