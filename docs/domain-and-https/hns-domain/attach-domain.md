[Handshake](https://handshake.org/) and ArGo both support [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [Skynet](https://siasky.net/), thus it is possible to connect the Handshake domain with Skynet as well as the Arweave site.

We are using [namebase.io](https://www.namebase.io/) to interact with Handshake.

:::tip Beta

Handshake Domain is currently in the Beta stage. Currently it is hard to set up and view HTTPS sites on Handshake because certificate authorities wonâ€™t issue SSL certificates for Handshake TLDs(Top-Level Domains), and no browsers support [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities).

Once major browsers start supporting the DANE/TLSA certificate, we will move it to the production stage.
