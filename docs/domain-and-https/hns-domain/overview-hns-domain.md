**Handshake** is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol where every peer is validating and in charge of managing the root DNS naming zone with the goal of creating an alternative to existing Certificate Authorities and naming systems.

In essence, Handshake takes a core piece of internet infrastructure, DNS's root zone file, and puts it on a blockchain. At a high level, Handshake is just decentralized DNS, but solving the [CA problem](https://www.namebase.io/blog/meet-handshake-decentralizing-dns-to-improve-the-security-of-the-internet/) and making it possible to self-custody, use, and transfer names permissionlessly in a publicly-verifiable way opens up exciting applications for developers that weren't feasible before Handshake. 

## Why Handshake?

Handshake is a naming protocol thatâ€™s backwards compatible with the existing DNS system. It does not replace the DNS protocol, but instead expands the root zone file where TLD(Top Level Domain) ownership information is stored by adding a distributed and decentralized blockchain-based system that no one controls and anyone can use. This allows for a root zone that is uncensorable, permissionless, and free of gatekeepers.

Every peer in the Handshake network cryptographically validates and manages the root zone, which completely removes the need for the Certificate Authority system (CAs). Names are logged on the Handshake blockchain, which is essentially one big distributed zone file to which anyone can add an entry.

## Applications

1. **Traditional Website** - Use a Handshake name to resolve traditional websites hosted on ArGo. 
    - **Scenario**: Personal blog, Existing websites, Decentralized domain backup

2. **Decentralized website** - Pair Handshake with decentralized storage solutions like Arweave, Skynet, etc. to create fully decentralized websites.
    - **Scenario**: Personal blog, Dapp frontends, Static websites

3. **Decentralized login** - Allow users to securely login to your website using their Handshake names without needing to store emails or passwords.
    - **Scenario**: Decentralized identity, Pseudonymous accounts and reputation, Secure E2E encryption without safety numbers

4. **Decentralized social application** - Develop decentralized social applications that minimize centralization while avoiding the the usability issues of federated applications.
    - **Scenario**: Decentralized Twitter, Decentralized Pinterest
