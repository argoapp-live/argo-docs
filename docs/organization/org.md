ArGo lets you create one/mutliple Organization accounts. The Organization will contain all their projects imported into it.
These accounts represent a group of people with shared ownership of projects, and there are many tools to manage subgroups of those people

## Steps to Create Organization

1. First go to the organization popup and click on `Create a Organization`

Follow these steps and you’ll soon be the owner of a brand-new organization.

## Members

Organizations are associated with individual people by way of members, which are simply a grouping of individual user accounts and repositories within the organization. People in the organization have full access to the repositories.

The Organization page shows you a simple dashboard of all the repositories, users and members that are under this organization.

The Members page shows the members present under the organization.
