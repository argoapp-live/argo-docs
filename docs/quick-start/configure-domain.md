## Steps to Attach a Centralized Domain

**Step 1** - Go to your Dashboard and select your Project.

**Step 2** - Click on Domain tab and enter the domain you would like to add.

**Step 3** - While attaching domain to a project, attach the records once in your DNS provider and verify it. Thanks to ArGo's **Automated DNS Resolver**, you won't have to change the records after every redeployment.

**Step 4** - From here you will have to confirm that you already own this domain.

**Step 5** - The domain must be verified before it is linked to the site. After adding the domain, add the records shown in the domain item and click on verify. This will check the configuration in the DNS provider. We then must wait for the domain to be propagated before clicking on Verify DNS configuration.

# HNS Domain

[Handshake](https://handshake.org/) and ArGo both support [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [Skynet](https://siasky.net/), thus it is possible to connect the Handshake domain with Skynet as well as the Arweave site.

We are using [namebase.io](https://www.namebase.io/) to interact with Handshake.

:::tip Beta

Handshake Domain is currently in the Beta stage. Currently it is hard to set up and view HTTPS sites on Handshake because certificate authorities wonâ€™t issue SSL certificates for Handshake TLDs(Top-Level Domains), and no browsers support [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities).

Once major browsers start supporting the DANE/TLSA certificate, we will move it to the production stage.
