ArGo lets you create one/mutliple Organization accounts. The Organization will contain all their projects imported into it.
These accounts represent a group of people with shared ownership of projects, and there are many tools to manage subgroups of those people

## Steps to Create Organization

**Step 1.** First go to the organization popup and click on `Create a Organization`
