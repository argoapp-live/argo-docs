ArGo is an all-in-one decentralize platform for automating modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, deployment pipeline with a single workflow and simplify your deployment process on decentralized cloud protocol.

## Get started

To get started with ArGo, learn how to create deploys. Options for creating deploys range from connecting a Git repository for continuous deployment to publishing a site folder with drag and drop. Use the Deploy to ArGo button on our Jamstack templates to create a Git repository linked to a ArGo site that you can experiment with.
